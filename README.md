#**TASKIT**

TaskIt is an open-source web application where small businesses and start-ups can advertise short-term, task-specific internships for students and novices in a given field. Unlike Indeed, Monster, Idealist, and other sites used to advertise interships and jobs, TaskIt has the explicit goal of creating opportunities for highly motivated but underqualified individuals to complete very explicit tasks for a business in order to make themselves more employable within the industry. TaskIt users understand that the short-term contract they enter has an explicit start and end date, explicit tasks to be completed, and an explicit understanding that there is no money involved in the process.
